# Contributing

If you are feeling like you want to contribute please send me a pull request!

Start by forking the project and then clone the repo to wherever you would like to work:

`$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/airlock`

or

`$ go get github.com/your-username/airlock`

Set up your development environment. Check out this [page](https://golang.org/doc/) if you need help.

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make sure all of the tests pass!

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/Phosphoresce/airlock/compare/).

I will review the pull request when I can, and I may add comments or suggestions before accepting it.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow the go [formatting standard](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting) or run `gofmt`
* Write a clear and concise commit message that includes what you did, how to validate it, and any issue ids.
