# Airlock
Airlock is intended to be a simple, secure P2P chat implementation.

## Design
The idea was originally intended to serve as a platform for some friends in the office to chat without the use of google hangouts.
Planned functionality is as follows:
- Simple chatroom
- Links
- Code collaboration?
- Fileshare?
- Pictures?
- GIFs/WEBMs?
